I am Jacob Allebach, a software engineer and game developer.

I have worked on several projects in the past which you can find in the projects tab of this site. These include a few games made using various mediums such as Processing, Twine 2, and Godot as well as a grading application used by Allegheny College. I am currently learning to develop games in the engines Unity and Godot, and I have experience working extensively with both.

I am proficient at working in the coding languages Java, Python, C, GDScript, and C# scripting for Unity. I collaborated with a large team of other students to create the automatic grading tool used in the Allegheny College computer science department that is still used today. I also advised 6th-8th grade students in creating games of their own using Processing, with each fully developing a miniature game. I'm open to communicating through many different means, including meeting in-person, using Discord or Slack, and any other online medium that is reasonably accessible.
