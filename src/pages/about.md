I am Jacob Allebach, a software engineer and game developer.

I have worked on a few projects in the past which you can find in the projects tab of this site. These include a couple of games made using Processing and Twine 2 as well as a grading application used by Allegheny College. While I don't currently have any other projects to show yet, I hope to have more presentable work in the near future. I am currently learning to develop games in the Unity engine, so the next big project on here will most likely be created through there.

I am proficient at working in the coding languages Java, Python, C, and C# scripting for Unity. I collaborated with a large team of other students to create the automatic grading tool used in the Allegheny College computer science department that is still used today. I also advised 6th-8th grade students in creating games of their own using Processing, with each fully developing a miniature game. I'm open to communicating through many different means, including meeting in-person, using Discord or Slack, and any other online medium that is reasonably accessible.
