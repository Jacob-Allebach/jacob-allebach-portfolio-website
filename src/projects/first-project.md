### Project Info

This game was made in Processing 3 for my final project in AP Computer Science at Winchester Thurston. It contains a map system to generate different rooms as well as enemies and traps with different attack patterns and defenses. This game was heavily inspired by the classic Atari game Adventure.

[Here](https://github.com/Jacob-Allebach/Journey_Game) is a link to the repository where you can download the files and play the game.
