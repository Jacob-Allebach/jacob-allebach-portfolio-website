### Project Info

*Completed Fall 2025*

This game was developed for the [20 Second Game Jam 2025](https://itch.io/jam/20-second-game-jam-2025) and served as a good refresher for developing games as it had been a while since I'd completed a project. This game jam ran the same as last year, giving participants a little over a month to create a game with the only restriction being that the gameplay must take 20 seconds or less. For this game, I created two levels where the player is given a collection of various food and drink items to fit into a grid without overlapping. The first level is the lunchbox, a 4x3 grid with typical school lunch items like an apple and sandwiches. The second level is the fridge, a much larger grid with two disconnected sections and many different grocery items of varying size. The fridge is much more difficult than the lunchbox and takes some good strategizing to successfully complete. In order to create this project, I wrote an algorithm that would take a grid shape and a set of blocks, then use a depth-first search algorithm to find all possible combinations of shapes that would fully fill the grid without overlapping or repeating shapes. I also created all the art assets myself, and I used sound effects and music from [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org).
