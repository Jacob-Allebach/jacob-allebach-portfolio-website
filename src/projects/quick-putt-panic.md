summary: A short golfing game made for the 20 Second Game Jam 2024

### Project Info

This game was developed for the [20 Second Game Jam 2024](https://itch.io/jam/20-second-game-jam-2024) as my first attempt at developing a game in the Godot engine. Participants were given a little over a month to create a game for this event with the only restriction being that the gameplay must take 20 seconds or less. The game I created is a singular mini-golf course where you must putt the ball to the end in under 20 seconds or you lose. You can putt whenever you want by clicking and dragging the mouse to control the aim and power of the swing, even while the ball is still rolling. In addition to the challenge of beating the course in the first place, there is a leaderboard where players can compete for the top 10 spots. During an attempt, the game keeps track of your stroke count and the time it takes to get to the end. A lower stroke count is prioritized over a quick time, so the top scores are those which hit the ball the fewest times to get to the hole the quickest. In order to run the leaderboard, I used the plugin [SilentWolf](https://silentwolf.com/) to keep track of the top scores and update them when a new high score is reached. I'm very happy with how this project turned out for it being my first completed game in Godot, and I would highly recommend using SilentWolf for Godot projects because it was incredibly easy to use.
