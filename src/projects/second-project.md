### Project Info

This game was made in Twine 2 as my final project for The Expressive and Persuasive Power of Video Games course at Allegheny College. It's a rogue-like game that features 17 different enemy encounters with custom art that are randomly chosen every playthrough. In order to complete this game, I had to learn the unique coding system offered by Twine 2.
