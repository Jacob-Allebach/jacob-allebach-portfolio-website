summary: A table tennis game made for the CorgiJam

### Project Info

*Completed January 2026*

This game was developed for the [CorgiJam](https://itch.io/jam/corgijam) run by publisher Finji as a way to celebrate the release of their game CorgiSpace and to encourage more developers to make smaller projects. The only rules this game jam had were to follow the 3 tenets of CorgiSpace when creating your project. These tenets were to *only do things that are easy and not obvious*, to *separate your ideas from your formulas*, and that *game design is about noticing things*. My game ended up as a short campaign where the player must defeat 7 opponents in table tennis with each increasing in difficulty as it progresses. The gameplay locks the player into four lanes on the table, and they must time their swing to hit the ball while also angling or curving the ball to mix up the enemy and tire them out. Initially, it was just going to be an increasing difficulty slider with nothing else to it, but I noticed it felt a bit empty when going through the different enemies one after another. This gave me the idea to add enemy introductions and descriptions so each one had more personality and flavor, which I think helped out a lot. All art and music assets were created by me using Aseprite and FL Studio, and the text font is from [OpenGameArt](https://opengameart.org). I think it would be cool in the future to create a version of this where two players can face off against each other as it would make things like the reverse curveball more practical for the player to use. It could also serve as a test to try implementing online play using the Godot engine, which would be useful for future projects.
