### Project Info

*Completed Spring 2022*

This application allows computer science professors to create a set of criteria that they desire to have completed on a given assignment and the Gatorgrader will automatically check through the code written and the output it produces to make sure the criteria is met. In addition to this being automatic for the professors, it is also very practical for the students because they can use it to check if they've correctly completed the assignment before turning it in so that they aren't confused about a low grade for not meeting the criteria.

The portion of the project that I helped work on was taking the criteria made by the professor in a YAML file and converting that data into a more easily workable format so that it can be processed and the commands can be run. This work was done during the process of converting the Gatorgrader from using Java to using Python to keep more up to date with what the college teaches.
